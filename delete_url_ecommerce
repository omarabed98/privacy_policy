Since you don’t have a specific delete page, you can use email as the deletion method:

**English (for policy / store form):**
Users can request deletion of their account and personal data by contacting us at **[support@irbidbasket.com](mailto:support@irbidbasket.com)**.

**If you must provide a URL (e.g. Play Console “delete_url_ecommerce” field):**
Use a placeholder like:
`https://irbidbasket.com/delete-account`

And on that page (when you create it), simply explain that users can email **[support@irbidbasket.com](mailto:support@irbidbasket.com)** to delete their account and data.
